    Welcome to the qs-housing configuration!
    To start configuring your new asset, please read carefully
    each step in the documentation that we will attach at the end of this message.

    Each important part of the configuration will be highlighted with a box.
    like this one you are reading now, where I will explain step by step each
    configuration available within this file.

    This is not all, most of the settings, you are free to modify it
    as you wish and adapt it to your framework in the most comfortable way possible.
    The configurable files you will find all inside client/custom/*
    or inside server/custom/*.

    Direct link to the resource documentation, read it before you start:
