## MZ-STOREROBBERY - a fork of the popular qb-storerobbery with or without mz-skills integration

By Mr_Zain#4139

- Outward file name changed to mz-storerobbery to track developments on forkline - all credit to Kakarot and QB-Core - this is a qb-core base script and all internal functions retain qb-storerobbery designations.
- A varied take on qb-storerobberies with a focus on RP servers. Removed stickynote keypad function and replaced with mhacking in connection with mz-usbhacks (can be changed if you are not using mz-skills and particularly the "Hacking" skill).
- Hack is harder at lower XP levels and becomes easier as player gains XP in Hacking.
- Progressbars added to register, safe and alcohol safe components to slow player down giving time for police response and RP between police and criminals.
- Substitutes "dirtymoney" for "markedbills".
- Configured to function with standard qb-core notifications and oKoKNotify.
- Configured to function with mz-skills or independently. 

## DEPENDENCIES

NOTE: You should have each of the dependencies other than qb-lock and mz-skills as part of a conventional qb-core install.

**[mz-skills](https://github.com/MrZainRP/mz-skills)** - to track skill progress. All credit to Kings#4220 for the original qb-skillz now **[B1-skillz](https://github.com/Burn-One-Studios/B1-skillz)**

**[progressbar](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/progressbar)**

**[qb-target](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-target)**

**[ps-ui](https://github.com/Project-Sloth/ps-ui)**

OPTIONAL: (Configured to work with okokNotify as well as base qb-core notifications).

## Installation Instruction

## A. MZ-SKILLS (NOT MANDATORY BUT RECOMMENDED)

1. Ensure that mz-skills forms part of your running scripts. If you have downloaded mz-skills before and are running it, please make sure you download the latest version of it. 

2. Run the "skills.sql" sql file and open the database. (This will add a data table to the existing "players" database which will hold the skill value for "Scraping" as well as other jobs)

## B. QB-CORE/SHARED/ITEMS.LUA

3. Add the following items to qb-core/shared/items.lua 

PLEASE NOTE: If you are using other mz- resources you will not need to re-add certain items. Also be sure not to have conflicting items with the same name in your qb-core/items.lua.

```lua
		-- mz-storerobbery
	["liquorkey"] 					 = {["name"] = "liquorkey", 					["label"] = "Liquor Storeroom", 		["weight"] = 200, 		["type"] = "item", 		["image"] = "liquorkey.png", 			["unique"] = false, 		["useable"] = true, 	["shouldClose"] = false,   ["combinable"] = nil,   ["description"] = "A curious key with the label 'Liquor Storeroom'."},
    ["dirtymoney"]                   = {["name"] = "dirtymoney",                    ["label"] = "Dirty Money",              ["weight"] = 0,         ["type"] = "item",      ["image"] = "dirtymoney.png",           ["unique"] = false,		["useable"] = true,     ["shouldClose"] = false,    ["combinable"] = nil,  ["description"] = "The ill-gotten proceeds of criminal activity."}, 
    	['usb2'] 				 	 	 = {['name'] = 'usb2', 			  	  			['label'] = 'Red USB', 					['weight'] = 100, 		['type'] = 'item', 		['image'] = 'usbred.png', 				['unique'] = false, 	['useable'] = false, 	['shouldClose'] = true,	   ['combinable'] = nil,   ['description'] = 'The Blank USB has downloaded a particular encryption marking it red.'},

```

## C. IMAGES

4. Add the images which appear in the "images" folder to your inventory images folder. 

If using lj-inventory, add the images to: lj-inventory/html/images/ - if you are using qb-inventory, add the images to qb-inventory/html/images/

## D. DOORLOCKS

5. Add the file "Liquorstore.lua" contaiend within the resource files to qb-doorlock/Configs to configure all alcohol doorlock configurations. (All alcohol store doorlocks are designed to operate with the conventional GTA V map, not MLO modifications)

## E. PS-DISPATCH

6. Please make sure you add the following to your ps-dispatch/server/sv_dispatchcodes.lua if you are using ps-dispatch:

```lua
["mz-storerobbery-register"] =  {displayCode = '10-90', description = "Forced Entry: Cash Register", radius = 0, recipientList = {'police'}, blipSprite = 628, blipColour = 1, blipScale = 1.5, blipLength = 2, sound = "Lose_1st", sound2 = "GTAO_FM_Events_Soundset", offset = "false", blipflash = "false"},
["mz-storerobbery-safe"] =  {displayCode = '10-90', description = "Store Robbery In Progress", radius = 0, recipientList = {'police'}, blipSprite = 350, blipColour = 1, blipScale = 1.5, blipLength = 2, sound = "Lose_1st", sound2 = "GTAO_FM_Events_Soundset", offset = "false", blipflash = "false"},
["mz-storerobbery-liquor"] =  {displayCode = '10-90', description = "Liquor Store Robbery", radius = 0, recipientList = {'police'}, blipSprite = 350, blipColour = 1, blipScale = 1.5, blipLength = 2, sound = "Lose_1st", sound2 = "GTAO_FM_Events_Soundset", offset = "false", blipflash = "false"},

```

## F. QB-POLICEJOB/EVIDENCE

7. In order to avoid console errors regarding the pulling of coordinates for the purposes of qb-policejob's evidence integration you will need to replace the existing :AddFingerPrint" evidence function with the following:

```lua
RegisterNetEvent('evidence:client:AddFingerPrint', function(fingerId, fingerprint, coords)
    local pos = GetEntityCoords(PlayerPedId(vector3))
    Fingerprints[fingerId] = {
        fingerprint = fingerprint,
        coords =  {
            x = pos.x,
            y = pos.y,
            z = pos.z - 0.8
        }
    }
end)
```

## F. FINALISATION

7. If you attend to all of the above steps you will need to restart the server in order for the new added items to be recognised by qb-core. 

8. Please restart your server ensuring that mz-storerobbery is ensured/starts after qb-core starts (ideally it should just form part of your [qb] folder).

9. Big thanks to Savage#2092 for configuring mz-storerobbery with the gabz MLO coordinates. If you experience errors, please do not annoy either of us as I am not offering supporting for MLO location changes - it's very easy to change vector coordinates in the config file.

### UPDATE LOG AND CHANGES RE: LATEST VERSION:

## **mz-storerobbery (v.1.6.0)**
- Optimised mz-skills skill check throughout resource;
- Significantly improved config options - now comprehensive for each of the 4x hacks: maze, varHack, scrambler and mHacking;
- Improved overall config layout re: additional gabz location support and grouping features to change; 

- Revamped from scratch the liquor store robbery removing safecracker dependency which is now equipped to use one of the 4x hacks available for convenience stored (it can be a different hack from the convenience store hack, they are not connected). 

Please see config references: 

```lua
Config.Hacktype = "mHacking"

Config.HacktypeLiquor = "varHack"
```

By default: 
A. a liquor store safe cannot be opened unless player has a "liquorkey" (which is also used to open the liquor store doors from the outside if you wish to use this functionality - if not, simply ignore the doorlock config); 
B. "liquorkey" item is set via config so it can be changed to any server item by changing: 

```lua
Config.LiquorReqItem = "liquorkey" 
```

C. The "liquorkey" is one of the drops a player has a random chance to obtain from robbing cash registers and convenience stores. This gives progression between convenience stores and liquor stores. The default chances have been set as follows, see these variables in the config: 
```lua
--Chance to drop item to get into liquor store robbery

Config.LiquorItem = "liquorkey"

Config.liquorKey = 4                           -- Percentage chance to find a "liquorkey" from a cash register

Config.liquorKeySafe = 15                      -- Percentage chance to find a "liquorkey" from a convenience store safe.
```

**PLEASE NOTE: **For those of you who are looking for optimisation and resource efficiency: 
1. you can delete "safecracker" from [standalone] unless your server uses it for other resources. 
2. you can also delete "qb-lock" as neither this resource (not any other mz- resource) uses the qb-lock dependency.
