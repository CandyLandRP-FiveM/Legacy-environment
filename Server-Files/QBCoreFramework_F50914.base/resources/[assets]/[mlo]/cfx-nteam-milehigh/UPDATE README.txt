It is very important that you follow this instruction.

If you previously had conflicts with other maps, if you do not follow the instructions for the update, you will have them again.

(If you didn't have conflicts with other maps, then you can update however you want)

This is how to update map .

 You dont need to update all files, and you cant just replace whole map.


1. On your server go to cfx-nteam-milehigh/stream/ymap and delete file

 - mloblock.ymap


2. From updated cfx-nteam-milehigh/stream take folder

- mlo 

and add on your server in resoruce/cfx-nteam-milehigh/stream


3. From updated cfx-nteam-milehigh take

- fxmanifest

and replace on your server in resoruce/cfx-nteam-milehigh
